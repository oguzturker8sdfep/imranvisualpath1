scala-js-dom
============

Provides a nice statically typed interface to the DOM such that it can be called from Scala code without resorting to `js.Dynamic`.

Also contains useful extension methods in `org.scalajs.dom.extensions`, which allow the DOM api to be used in a more idiomatic and fluent way. The goal of this project is to provide a thin-but-idiomatic-scala interface to modern browser APIs. In particular:

- Deprecated properties/methods/types will not be present.
- IE-only, Chrome-only, FF-only, and in general browser-specific attributes will not be present.
- The name of a Scala type should map directly to the name of the corresponding Javascript type.
- Any type which is a Javascript type (e.g. you can `instanceof` in javascipt) should be a Scala `class`; any other interface which isn't a Javascript type should be a `trait`.
- Read-only members should be `def`, and not-directly-instantiable classes should have `private` constructors.
- `org.scalajs.dom` contains DOM class/member stubs, while `org.scalajs.dom.extensions` contains implicit conversions and useful Scala types (e.g. `Color`) to make usage of the DOM more idiomatic Scala.

Usage
-----

Add the following to your sbt build definition:

    libraryDependencies += "org.scala-lang.modules.scalajs" %% "scalajs-dom" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"

then enjoy the types available in `org.scalajs.dom`.

See also [roll](https://github.com/lihaoyi/roll) ([live demo](http://lihaoyi.github.io/roll/)) and [scala-js-games](https://github.com/lihaoyi/scala-js-games) for an example of its use. There remain lots more cleanup to do, but this should be a reasonable place to start from. Pull requests/forks are welcome!

Contributing
------------

Scala-js-dom is a work in progress. The current code base is a hodgepodge of auto-generated/scraped/hand-tweaked code, and is full of rough edges. If you see something that you think can be improved, feel free to send a pull request. These could include:

- Improved doc-comments; who doesn't love better docs?
- Missing methods/properties/classes; send the PR adding it in including it together with a link to an authoritative source (e.g. MDN) and it should get merge
- Additional extensions (in `org.scalajs.dom.extensions`). These currently represent an arbitrary collection of helpers that have been needed so far. If there's some implicit that you find you need and you think other people will to, send a pull request and we can talk about it.
